# Sportify

After entering university, many people often struggle to find someone to play sports with and are unaware of available venues. Therefore, we aim to design a platform to solve these problems.  

This platform will provide the following features:  

- **Group Matchmaking**: Users (organizers) can initiate group activities and fill in relevant details such as location, time, and the number of participants.  
- **Registration**: Other users can browse group activities on the platform, select the ones they are interested in, and sign up to play together.
